This is my minor project in the field of data science at my uni.
open to suggestions.

# About the project
The project is quite basic , it is my first project in data science. The project presents you a linear graph as output of a particular ticker listed in the New York Stock Exchange.
The code has its data set inherited from Yahoo Finance and using libraries like matplotlib to help in better data visualisation.
